# Gibbs-Motif-Sampler

This is Gibbs 3.2 formerly located at http://ccmbweb.ccv.brown.edu/gibbs/gibbs.html

Docs are coming. :-)
In the mean time, clone the repo, unzip src.zip, cd to src directory, and run:  make -f make.linux 
to create a new binary.
Test it by running:  ../bin/Gibbs.linux ../data/crp.fa 16 20 -n -E 2
